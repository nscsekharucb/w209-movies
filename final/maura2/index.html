	 <h1> The Movie Calendar, as defined by Film Studios</h1>

	 <h3>The release date of a movie can define profitability or critical acclaim teh film receives </h3>

	 <p>
Film studios are very careful about when they release which films to the public. In terms of movies, certain times of year are thought of as having different purpose for films. The timing can set the stage for how a film is viewed or who the most audience would be. 

<br><br> Generally December has come of the year’s best films (as decided by critics and viewers alike) and winter months tend to offer higher box office profits or award-worthy movies. But, throughout the year each month has a stereotype followed by film studios. These stereotypes include 

<br><br> Studios tend to slate their movie based on a couple factors - most of these motives are to achieve the biggest economic return as possible. 
<ul>Is there something timely or seasonal that will make audiences specifically interested in our film this month?</ul>
<ul>Are there similar movies coming out at the same time that we don’t want to compete with at the box office?</ul>
<ul>Are we prioritizing our movies that have the best chances to make money by putting them in the best months for ticket sales?</ul>

<h2> But do we actually see this reflected in the Gross profits of movies in 2016? </h2>

Gross profit per month or 2016 split by Studio.

<br> <br>
For each individual film studio, it can be tough to see the calendar of film releases reflected in the plot but it is clear that higher earning moves tend to occur in the second half of the year. You see the streams widen between June and July indicating higher profit and increased sales at the box office. These streams remain inflated over the remainder of the year tailin off only slightly in December when people may wait until the new year to see some of the season Award worth films.

<h2> What does a Movie's relsease Month say about the film and/or the Studio's expectation of the film? </h2>
<p> 
<h3> Here is what the movie Calendar really says about movies: </h3>
<ul> January - The movie could be slated for a prestigious award of leftovers from the previous season.</ul>
<ul> February - Seasonal movies for the month of love. February comes bearing even worse movies than late January. Most likely to see Valentine’s Day date movie flicks or some of the studio’s worst movies in order to avoid competing with the better films that usually come out in summer or early winter. </ul>
<ul> March - A continuation of February dump month. But, there can be some unique, well-crafted films with fresh concepts and unusual subject matter. </ul>
<ul> April - Often a big month for indie films and smaller budget studios that are interesting and well-done but don’t have summer blockbuster potential. </ul>
<ul> May - An introduction to the summer blockbuster season but not the excitement of the summer films yet to come. </ul>
<ul> June - Summer blockbuster is in full effect! High action and high budget films. </ul>
<ul> July - Fireworks, American pride, more explosions, and plenty of plotlines that revolve around saving the world as we know it. Lots of world-ending, robot/alien scenes that are sure to deafen your ears and widen your eyes. </ul>
<ul> August - Back-to-school story lines. Plotlines focus on partying, blue humor, and “coming-of-age” films to reflect life of those still in school.</ul>
<ul> September - A second lull of the year with another dump month after the summer of action. As with April, it could offer some promising independent films. </ul>
<ul> October - Halloween, spooky, scary films galore. If it isn’t horror, it probably will not be released in October</ul>
<ul> November - With holidays and the remainder of family events around the corner, November comes with an assortment of family dramas and family movies. It also marks the beginning of the big Oscar-contenders.</ul>
<ul> December - the prime month for movie releases. Oscar-bait movies are releasing in order to be fresh on the minds of Academy voters. </ul>
